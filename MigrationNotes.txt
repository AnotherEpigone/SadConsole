====== Intro

- A lot of structual changes to split out rendering from SadConsole. You now need to add SadConsole.Host.MonoGame or SadConsole.Host.SFML to your project.

- All console's have a viewport again, eliminating the ScrollingConsole type. This is implemented in a few properties.
  - ScrollingConsole.ViewPort -> Console.View

- SadConsole.Global is gone. All properties moved to SadConsole.GameHost.Instance

===== TODO

- (?) Components should have a before/after ability where SortOrder < 5 run before the core code and >=5 run after.
- Check fullscreen to and from not setting render sizes correctly in monogame.
- Print for surface can be optimized. Use SetEffect(IEnumerable) to mass update effects instead of individual cells.

====== New Features

- Controls have a Tag property for user-definable data.
- Window now has the following features:
  - Shown event when the window is made visible.
  - OnShown protected virtual method.
  - OnHidden protected virtual method.
- Draw/Update have restored the TimeSpan parameter.
- ControlHost component can add the GUI framework to any console.
- SadConsole.Global no longer exists. Properties from this static type now live in SadConsole.GameHost.Instance.


====== Migration notes

Core
- (RENAME) Font/FontMaster -> Font
- (RENAME) SadConsole.Global -> SadConsole.GameHost

CellSurface/Console
- (RENAME) Width -> BufferWidth (Console specifically has Width which just forward BufferWidth)
- (RENAME) Height -> BufferHeight (Console specifically has Height which just forward BufferHeight)
- (RENAME) Components -> SadComponents
- (CHANGE) Console.New(surface) now wraps the existing surface, using its reference. Doesn't copy cells anymore.
